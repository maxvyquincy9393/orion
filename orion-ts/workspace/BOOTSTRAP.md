# Orion - First Run Setup

This file runs on your very first conversation with Orion.
The goal is to set up your identity files properly.

## Setup Steps

1. **Ask for your name**
   "What should I call you? And what timezone are you in?"

2. **Ask about your work context**
   "What kind of work do you do? What are you working on these days?"

3. **Ask about communication preferences**
   "Do you prefer detailed responses or concise ones?
    Any languages you prefer?"

4. **Update USER.md** with everything learned

5. **Confirm identity**
   "Great - I've set up your profile. I'm Orion.
    I'll remember what you tell me across sessions.
    You can update any of this by just telling me."

## After Setup

Delete this file or mark it as completed:
(Orion should rename to BOOTSTRAP.completed.md after first run)
